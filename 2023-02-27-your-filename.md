How does Tianjing Space Provided Sustainability?
—— Tianjing of Bai: Possibility of space utilization extended beyond local customs and daily activities
The courtyard, a closed and open space, is an interesting insertion to the building. The introduction of courtyards in houses may have originated due to practical reasons, but it has integrated into people’s lives as a way of living. Therefore, contemporary courtyards in various regions are a result of not only environmental practicalities but also social and cultural influences. Courtyard buildings are widely distributed around the world, such as in Berlin, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Syria, Udaipur, and Aleppo. In China, courtyard buildings are most widely distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (张葳, & 邹航, 2021). In addition, in Dali, Yunnan, Bai also has its unique "Tianjing" space culture. "Tianjing", as the iconic symbol of Bai folk houses, is the product of the interaction of nature, architecture, and culture, which increases the possibility of diversification of architectural space. 

Courtyards are enclosed spaces surrounded by walls or buildings but are open to the sky (Rapoport, 2007). Tianjing and courtyard are similar but different. The word "Tianjing" was first seen in the Marching Chapter of "Sun Tzu". In its annotations, Tianjing is steep on all sides, where the stream flows, and it is a natural well（王曼曼 王梦林, 2017). In Bai folk houses, such a courtyard space can usually be seen from the bottom to the sky enclosed by the eaves, as if looking up from the bottom of a well, so it is called "Tianjing". According to "Ci Hai" (n.d.), the usual interpretation of Tianjin refers to “the surrounding or three sides of the house and the open space in the middle of the wall”. However, apart from the broad definition, how to define Tianjing and distinguish it from the courtyard?

Tianjing and courtyards are confused In many sayings, but they are different. Here I list four reasons why Tianjing is different from courtyards: First, the scale is different. In China, courtyards generally take the benchmark scale of "a hundred feet as a shape". However, the dimension of Tianjing is often constrained by the "Zhang Shi(丈室)" connected to it. "Li Qi Tu Shuo" states: "The shape of Tianjing is either square or long, like a single pole." The so-called single paddle is a single oar for rowing, and the length-to-width ratio of the paddle board is about four to five to one. 
Second, the spatial form is different. Tianjing mainly has four types of basic plane forms: "凹", "口", "H" and "日". What Tianjing breaks through is the enclosed architectural form, and what it solves is the closed feeling of the interior, giving life habits and situations Bring new hope. The size of Tianjing changes with the height of the eaves, and the proportion of the area is built to match the size of its own courtyard (Shang, 2019). The courtyard usually has no plan form restrictions. Tianjing is integrated with the Mingtang (明堂) and the hall. It is a well-like space without a concrete interface, and it is a grey space between indoors and outdoors. On the contrary, the courtyard is an outdoor space, which contains the imitation of nature by human beings, and embodies people's love of mountains and rivers and the harmonious coexistence of nature (李琴, 2016). Tianjing is part of a single building, while the courtyard is the outdoor space of the building complex, forming a picture-ground relationship with the buildings in the building complex.

Third, the structure is different. From the point of view of the detailed structure, Tianjing has a series of structures for lighting, drainage, and air dissipation, while the courtyards are mainly outdoor structures such as paving and potted plants. The "system of doors and halls" of ancient Chinese architecture is the main reason for the formation of courtyards. Structurally speaking, a courtyard is composed of gates, halls, and corridors; there is no "gate" among the constituent elements of Tianjing.

Fourth, the degree of function is different. Tianjing is far from the courtyard in terms of function. According to Confucianism, gardens and courtyards are places where people get close to nature. However, due to its small scale and distance from real nature, Tianjing is more used as a space for living activities.

Based on the above, the definition of Tianjing discussed in this article is a building space without a roof enclosed by houses or walls on four or three sides inside a single building. 

The formation of Bai people’s Tianjing-style buildings is mainly influenced by natural factors, and the residents have gradually explored different living and production space functions. Dali City is located in the west of Yunnan Province, China. The mountainous area and the Erhai Lake cover a large area. It is a low-latitude plateau basin that is high in the northwest and low in the southeast. Restricted by natural conditions, the dwellings in the Bai area of Dali are closely integrated with the topography and mountains and rivers. Unlike the custom of the north-south orientation of houses in the Central Plains, the orientation is mainly east, with mountains behind and water facing. The distribution of courtyards in Xizhou folk houses fully adapts to the natural topography and is built on the hillside. Bai folk houses adopt the compact layout form of small Tianjing connecting each room. While occupying less cultivated land, use mountainous areas and wasteland slopes to build houses. They will also adjust the basic units of the "workshop" according to the terrain and combine them flexibly. Bai dwellings usually use wind energy for ventilation, cooling, and exhaust, and use solar energy for heating (王晶瑶, 王泓云, 韩菡, 刘有通, & 杨玲玲, 2022). Residential houses mainly realize the microclimate adjustment inside the building through central Tianjing.
 
Tianjing provides space for daily life and production activities for the Bai people. In Tianjing, there are mostly wells and stone slabs, which are used as places for washing vegetables and leisure. For the sake of safety, there are no windows on the outer walls of traditional houses, and all the light comes from Tianjing. Central Tianjing is the center of Bai people's life activities. The dimension of big Tianjing in the center is usually about 9×9×4m. Here they eat or treat guests to drink, dry clothes, plant flowers and trees for landscape, chat, and dry crops and food. Among the groups who make a living from tie-dyeing and weaving, the residents of big Tianjing are also the main place for production activities. In addition, according to observations and interviews with local people, Tianjing with a larger scale (for example, more than 20×20m) is also used for public activities, such as weddings(罗红, 2011), funerals(梁永佳, 2006), and meetings. Smaller Tianjing (such as 9×4.5×3m) can be used as a shadow wall, a rockery pool for landscape, etc., as a transitional space when entering the house. It also reflects the status of the host family. The small Tianjing (for example, 4.2×3.1×3m and 4.6×2.2×3m) connected to the ear chambers was used for drying clothes, digging wells, placing inscriptions, and stacking sundries, etc. Some residents also connected the small Tianjing to the side room, turning it into a part of the kitchen, which can be used to dry food and stack firewood. 
 

When Bai Tianjing is used as private space and public space, it is obviously different from the courtyard buildings in Qatar in the Middle East. According to the aforementioned, the Bai people use different dimensions of Tianjing for different functions. Usually, the small-scale Tianjing is used for the private activity space of a family inside the building, while the larger-scale Tianjing is also used for the public activity space in addition to the private space. According to an interview with local Dinghe Yang, ordinary Bai people usually do not make gender divisions for Tianjing space in buildings. For wealthy families, the corridor connecting Tianjing on the second floor will be used as a private space for the host's unmarried daughter.

However, courtyard spaces have different rules in Qatar in the Middle East. A typical form of architecture typical for the Middle East is courtyard housing. The courtyard represents a space where the value of privacy was respected within the home. It offered the freedom and openness of an outdoor space, while being enclosed within an external structure that maintained privacy from the outside world. This was especially important for women, who mainly occupied the domestic sphere, away from public view and public life where business was conducted.

However, with the development of local tourism, residents going out to work to earn money, the introduction of new building materials and other factors, villagers like to get rid of or demolish their old courtyard houses and rebuild new concrete houses when they have money. When building a new house, the small Tianjing in the traditional Bai people’s residential buildings are usually not preserved, and the big Tianjing often loses its form and becomes an ordinary courtyard. According to an interview with local Yang Dinghe, the introduction of new building materials and technological equipment has changed the concept of local people. Some new building materials, such as concrete, allow local people to ignore the role of microclimate adjustment brought about by traditional building forms when building new houses. That is to say, from the perspective of local people, the negative spaces of Tianjing in the traditional Bai people's houses are not regarded as "profitable buildings". A newer generation of locals might think that smooth brick and concrete houses make their homes more presentable.

To sum up, "Tianjing" is the product of the interaction of nature, architecture, and culture, which makes the interior space of Bai people's dwellings more multi-layered and diversified. With the development of the times, the Tianjing space may be lost to the new Bai buildings. Apart from a single living space, perhaps Tianjing has more industrial and economic value. Tianjing Space may consider expanding its dimensions and being exclusively used in specific industries such as tie-dye. Attempts to address these issues may provide more diverse and functional spaces for new-age Bai architecture.
